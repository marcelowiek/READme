# Who am I?

Iâ€™m a video editor graduated in Social Communication with emphasis in Advertising from University of Vale do Rio dos Sinos, with over 15 years of experience in the area and I have worked with educational content since 2015. I'm a bilingual person, nowadays I'm studying Spanish focusing in becoming trilingual and I'm studying Frontend as well (HTML and CSS emphasis) looking forward to learn Javascrit, React and related in a soon future.

# What else did I get involved?

In addition to traditional work, I have worked as a social media and writer (reviews) on my old project Fast Food Cultural, a news website for the pop world with social responsibility; I worked as a content producer for my own YouTube channel about games, humor and cooking; I produced a podcast that dealt with general subjects; I had a game livestream project for almost 4 years; and I have also worked as a volunteer in Dublin for the Cancer Institute thrift store. In addition, I really like culinary matters, bicycles, cultures, games and I venture into 3D modeling and programming as well.

# And about te future...

My biggest goal is to have a happy life through personal and professional development, always seeking knowledge and learning new things, as well as standing out in the areas of video editing, scripting, 3D modeling and programming.
